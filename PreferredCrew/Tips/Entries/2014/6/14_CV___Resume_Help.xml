    <richText>     Every week, a large number of people ask what makes for a great CV.&#xA0; Anybody who has worked with a crew agent knows that if you ask 3 different agents, you will get 5 different opinions on how to write a great CV.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m going to skip the obvious (spell check) and the ridiculous (good quality paper).&#xA0; I can also tell you, you cannot make a CV that will be appreciated by everybody.&#xA0; If that is the kind of magic formula you are seeking - stop reading here.&#xD;&#xD;     Instead, I would like to outline what makes it easy for me to sell you as crew (yes, I&#x2019;m a crew agent, and selling sailors is what I do).&#xD;&#xD;     Your CV is a communication tool.&#xA0; It should clearly outline to the reader how you will solve their problems.&#xA0; Don&#x2019;t think in terms of &#x201C;let me tell you about me.&#x201D;&#xA0; Instead think &#x201C;let me tell you what I can do for you.&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;     When an employer puts out a call for candidates, they need something done.&#xA0; The better the program, the more well-defined the role they need to fill.&#xA0; This is key.&#xA0; No matter how many action verbs you use in your CV, if you do not clearly outline that you are what they need, you will not get a call.&#xD;&#xD;A very quick outline for writing an effective CV:&#xD;&#xD;	1.	Know the position you are seeking.&#xA0; If you cannot clearly identify what you want to do, then you cannot communicate that information to your next employer.&#xA0;&#xD;	2.	Know what problems that position needs to solve (Captain: lead a small team to deliver the highest quality service to the guests in an environment of safest possible procedures &#x2026; or &#x2026; project managing a new build program from design to delivery.&#xA0; Same position, very different set of problems.)&#xD;	3.	Concisely communicate that you deliver these skills.&#xA0; The easiest way to show an employer you can do this is to demonstrate that you have already done it.&#xA0; If you have previously held the position then this part should be easy.&#xA0; If you are moving to a new position then you need to communicate the aspects of what you have done before that translates to what you want to do next.&#xD;	4.	If what you are writing does not underscore the point that you solve their problems &#x2013; leave it off or de-emphasize it.&#xA0; Your CV is not a list of every job you have ever held.&#xA0; It is an honest (never, ever lie) outline of what you have done that is relevant in both time and skills.&#xD;&#xD;     As you may guess &#x2013; your CV should change throughout your career.&#xA0; As you move up the ladder, those entry level positions should get less real-estate on that paper.&#xA0; Don&#x2019;t just keep adding jobs &#x2013; tell a cohesive story.&#xD;&#xD;     Lastly, if you are not comfortable editing yourself or need help expressing the above &#x2013; ask a professional for help.&#xA0; They are not cheap but they are well worth the cost.&#xA0; At Preferred we do not offer this service &#x2013; but we frequently point crew toward AdBits in Fort Lauderdale &#x2013; they do a great job with crew CVs.&#xD;&#xD;     I hope this helps and I look forward to some great communicating CVs!</richText>
